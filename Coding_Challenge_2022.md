# Coding Challenge

## Fullstack Development

Image a small and a large cube. A small cube can be placed inside a large cube. Four small cubes fit in a large cube. Each cube has __an unique ID (String)__, an __optional owner ID (String or null)__ as well as __a type (large or small)__. Please implement the following tasks in TypeScript without using additional packages (apart from Jest and TypeScript).

Try to implement the tasks with the tools that TypeScript provides. Think of the tasks as an API for other developers.

1. Write an asynchronous function to create a cube (large and small). The first parameter should be the type of the cube (large or small). The second parameter is an optional owner ID. The last parameter is an optional array with unique IDs for creating small cubes (recursive creation with a maximal depth of 1).

    a. The function to be implemented should have this signature:

        `async createCube(type: KindOfCube, id: string, ownerId?: string | null, childIds?: string[]) : Promise<Cube>`
  
    b. Consideer that a cube that is inside another cube inherits its owner.

2. Write an asynchronous function for deleting a cube. This function gets the list of all created cubes as the first parameter. The second paramter is the ID of the cube to be deleted. A third optional parameter indicates if cubes that are inside the to-be-deleted cube should also be deleted. This last parameter is false by default. If the contained cubes in the to-be-deleted cube should not be deleted themselves they should have an empty owner afterwards. An error should occur if the given cube ID does not exist.

    a. The function to be implemented should have this signature:
  
        `async deleteCube(cubes: Cube[], id: string, deleteChilds?: boolean) : Promise<Cube[]>`

3. Check your implemention with unit tests using Jest ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)). Please test every kind of behaviour that you can derive from this task. 

We provide you with a template for this coding challenge.
